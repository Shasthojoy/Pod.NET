# Pod.NET

C# framework to load file formats of the 1997 Ubisoft racing game POD (Planet of Death) into an object-oriented hierarchy, closely trying to resemble what the original Ubisoft classes might have provided to modify the files.

Usage
=====

The library is slowly being developed - when I find the time, I work on it. Right now, you can only use it for testing the decryption phase and read BL4 events.
